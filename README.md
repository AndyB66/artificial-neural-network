ArtificialNeuralNetwork
=======================

An implementation of a (initially) fully-connected, feed-forward artificial neural network written in Java utilizing iRPROP+ training algorithm.

##Implementation Details

###iRPROP+
iRPROP+, or improved Resilient Propogation with Weight Backtracking, is a first-order optimization algorithm used for supervised learning of artificial neural networks.  Based on Rprop developed by Martin Riedmiller and Heinrich Braun in 1992, iRPROP+ was created by Christian Igel and Michael HÃ¼sken in 2000 as an improved variant.

The Rprop family of error optimization takes into account the sign of the partial derivative over each pattern, updating all weights independently.
