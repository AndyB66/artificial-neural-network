ArtificialNeuralNetwork
=======================

An implementation of a (initially) fully-connected, feed-forward artificial neural network written in Java utilizing iRPROP+ training algorithm.

##Artificial Neural Networks
An artificial neural network is a computational representation of biological neural networks, aiming to reproduce its learning ability.  Neural networks in general excel at machine learning and more specifically, pattern matching, because of its resilient and adaptive nature.  Neural networks are often known for being strong classifiers (although they are not limited to this aspect), and as a result, have wide array of uses.


##Implementation Details

###iRPROP+
iRPROP+, or improved Resilient Propogation with Weight Backtracking, is a first-order optimization algorithm used for supervised learning of artificial neural networks.  Based on Rprop developed by Martin Riedmiller and Heinrich Braun in 1992, iRPROP+ was created by Christian Igel and Michael HÃ¼sken in 2000 as an improved variant.

The Rprop family of error optimization takes into account the sign of the partial derivative over each pattern, updating all weights independently.
